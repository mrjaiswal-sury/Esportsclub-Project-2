# Esportsclub-Project-2


I created an microservice that reads from this queue and uses Google Vision API to validate images in a GC storage bucket. 

If an image is found to be explicit, delete it from the bucket while publishing appropriate events back on the queue

This is in continuation of Esportsclub Project-1
